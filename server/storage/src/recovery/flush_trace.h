/**
 * @brief Timing census of the write-ahead log's flush groups.
 *
 * @details The response time of a synchronous durable commit is a single
 * end-to-end number, and the quantities that compose it (how long a group waits
 * to be scheduled, how many epochs it carries, how long its write and its
 * fdatasync take, and how long a waiter takes to resume once the group is
 * published) are not separable from outside the process. This records the
 * boundaries of each phase and leaves the arithmetic to offline analysis.
 *
 * Enabled by setting LINEAIRDB_FLUSH_TRACE to a path prefix. The gate is read
 * once at construction, and every call site tests it before reading a clock.
 * All storage, including each thread's commit buffer, is reserved during
 * construction: no recording path allocates, locks, or writes to a file.
 *
 * The trace observes; it never decides. No recording call alters control flow,
 * and none is placed between the durable watermark's store and the
 * notification that releases waiters.
 *
 * @par Output contract
 * Each dump writes its data files under its own generation, so no dump ever
 * replaces a file another dump published. `<prefix>_meta.csv` is the manifest:
 * it names the generation and is replaced last, atomically, and only if every
 * data file closed without error. A reader takes the generation from the
 * manifest and opens `<prefix>_g<generation>_*.csv`; until the manifest changes
 * it keeps describing the previous complete dump. An exclusive lock on
 * `<prefix>.lock` admits one producer per prefix; a process that cannot take
 * it records nothing.
 *
 * A dump guarantees one immutable prefix per stream, not one instant across
 * streams: the counts are taken one after another, so a commit row can refer to
 * a group published after the group count was read. An analysis that joins
 * across the files has to tolerate a few unmatched rows at its end.

   * that reads write or sync durations has to drop those rows.
   *
   * The interval between `encode_end` and `write_begin` holds the capacity

   * is deliberately outside every named phase so that `write` means the group's
   * own write and nothing else.
