/**
 * @brief Run the Silo commit protocol for a transaction whose read and
 * write sets were assembled by the caller through the read API.
 *
 * @details
 * The entries carry values only; nothing in them points into storage
 * memory:
 *   - reads:       (key, observed TID, found)
 *   - writes:      (key, value | delete)
 *   - SI ops:      (secondary key, primary key, add | remove)
 *   - range reads: scan bounds plus the returned key list
 *
 * The protocol is Silo's commit protocol (paper §4.4), bracketed by an
 * epoch join and leave; [added] marks steps beyond the paper, for by-key
 * inputs and SQL insert / UNIQUE semantics:
 *
 *   Resolve   R1  [added] map every key to its DataItem
 *             R2  [added] materialize blank slots for fresh write keys
 *             R3  [added] reject in-request UNIQUE duplicates
 *   Phase 1   1.1 [paper] lock the write set in address order
 *             1.2 [paper] re-read the global epoch (serialization point)
 *   Phase 2   2.1 [paper] exact reads: observed TIDs unmoved
 *             2.2 [added] ranges: replay the scans, compare key lists
 *                         (membership only; row TIDs are validated
 *                         at 2.1)
 *             2.3 [added] inserts: the claimed key still holds no row
 *             2.4 [added] UNIQUE recheck after the lock wait
 *   Phase 3   3.1 [paper] install values; deletes become tombstones
 *             3.2 [paper] log snapshot before unlock (when logging)
 *             3.3 [paper] publish even TIDs stamped with the 1.2 epoch
 *             3.4 [added] hand slots left empty to the reaper for
 *                         deferred physical purge
 *             3.5 [paper] enqueue the log set, leave the epoch
 *
 * @note Read validation is logical: Phase 2 re-reads every key and
 * replays every scan, then requires the observed TIDs and the result
 * key lists to be unchanged. Silo instead guards ranges with Masstree
 * node versions — referred to as physical validation here — but a node
 * version is bound to a node pointer, and this server keeps no
 * per-transaction state that could pin such a pointer across the RPC
 * boundary, so its lifetime cannot be guaranteed.
 *
 * @param policy Whether this commit's acknowledgement waits for its epoch
 * to reach the device. A logger that writes no records ignores it: step 3.5
 * has nothing to wait for.
 * @param[out] abort_reason When non-null and the attempt aborts,
 * receives a short label naming the failed check, such as
 * `exact_read_tid_moved`, `primary_range_result_changed`,
 * `duplicate_primary_key`, or `unique_si_exists_after_lock`.
 * @return true when the transaction committed; false on abort, after
 * every lock this attempt acquired has been released.
