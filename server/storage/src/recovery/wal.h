/**
 * @brief Result of scanning the WAL at startup.
 *
 * @details
 * `Ok` means every frame up to the end of the log was complete and
 * consistent, and `frontier` is the epoch of the last one; a log with no
 * frames yields frontier 0. An incomplete or checksum-broken frame at the
 * end of the log is repaired rather than reported: the bytes it left behind
 * are overwritten with zeroes, `tail_truncated` is set, and the scan still
 * succeeds. Repair requires that no intact frame survives beyond the
 * damage: one that does is taken as evidence that the damage sits in a
 * region older appends already synced.
 *
 * `Corrupt` means damage the scan will not repair:
 *   - a checksum-broken complete frame that is not the last bytes of the
 *     log, whatever follows it;
 *   - a damaged tail with an intact frame surviving beyond it, or one the
 *     search cannot classify within its I/O budget;
 *   - a magic, version, flags or length anomaly whose header does not read
 *     as a torn prefix of the frame constants (one that does is treated as
 *     an interrupted write and repaired instead);
 *   - and, in a complete checksum-valid frame, a regressed or zero epoch or
 *     a payload anomaly.
 * Nothing is zeroed and the caller must fail-stop: the log may be missing
 * records that were already acknowledged as durable.
 *
 * @note Ambiguity is resolved toward fail-stop: a torn group whose pages
 * persisted out of order, or torn user data that embeds a byte-exact intact
 * frame, can fail-stop a repairable log, and manually zeroing the damaged
 * tail then recovers it. The reverse never happens: repair never discards a
 * frame that another intact frame vouches for, and a tail the search cannot
 * classify within its I/O budget also fail-stops.

/**
 * @brief The single write-ahead log: one file of epoch frames, written by
 * one flusher.
 *
 * @details
 * Frames are written in place, at an offset the instance tracks, into a
 * region already written out with zeroes, so that a group's fdatasync
 * persists data and not the size, allocation or extent-state metadata a
 * growing file drags in (see Config::wal_initial_capacity_bytes).
 *
 * Two consequences run through the rest of this class. The end of the log
 * is not the end of the file: it is where the zeroes begin, which is why
 * nothing may be written before ScanAndRepair has found it. And the zeroes
 * ahead of the log are an invariant, not an accident: they are what makes
 * an interrupted write recognisable, so a repair restores them.
 *
 * Frame layout, little-endian:
 *   magic(u32) version(u16) flags(u16) payload_len(u32) epoch(u32) crc32c(u32)
 *   payload
 *
 * The checksum covers the header up to but excluding the crc field, plus
 * the payload, so a bit flip in the epoch or length is detected too. The
 * payload is the msgpack encoding of a non-empty record list carrying the
 * frame's epoch, and frame epochs are non-decreasing. No frame ever carries
 * an empty record list; the caller keeps empty buckets out of AppendGroup,
 * which refuses them rather than skipping them.
 *
 * @note An exclusive flock keeps out a second process; it does not make a
 * second concurrent appender inside this process defined.
